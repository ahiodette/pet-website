        <h3>What is a fish?</h3>

            <strong>Fish</strong> are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the
            tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys,
            and
            cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. <em>Tetrapods</em> emerged within lobe-finned
            fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by
            excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within
            the
            same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is
            not
            considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense,
            including tetrapods.The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a
            phylogenetic classification.
        </p>
        <p>The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during
            the
            Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more
            agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era,
            diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that
            protected
            them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as
            sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
